I. Compilation/installation problems.

Q.I.0:
I got during compilation:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lqt-mt
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

A.I.0:
The error indicates, that Qt library isn't installed in your system (or
is istalled, but in strange path). You should find libqt-mt.so* file(s)
in your system and then try to set correct path in Makefile file, for example:

LFLAGS  = -lqt-mt -lxml2 -L/path/to/your/qt/lib/directory/

Sakreble! is developed with PLD Linux Distribution
(http://www.pld-linux.org/) and works fine with it. I plan to add
configure script, but I have to learn about autoconf :(
